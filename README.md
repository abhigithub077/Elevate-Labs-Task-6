# 📊 Online Sales Data Analysis (2023–2025)
## 🔍 Introduction

This project analyzes a dataset of online sales in India between 2023 and 2025.
The goal was to explore sales trends, customer behavior, and revenue growth using MySQL queries and generate clear, submission-ready results.

The dataset contains information such as order dates, customers, products, payment methods, transaction amounts, and cities.

## 🛠️ What I Did

Cleaned & Prepared Data

Worked with DD-MM-YYYY formatted dates using STR_TO_DATE.

Extracted year and month for time-based analysis.

Performed SQL Analysis

Calculated monthly revenues.

Found top 15 revenue-generating months.

Counted order volumes by month.

Combined revenue + order volume in one summary.

Analyzed the last 12 months from the most recent order.

Compiled Results

Exported all results into analysis_results.xlsx.

Each sheet shows top 15–20 rows for clear insights.
